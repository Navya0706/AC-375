Given an array of size N. The task is to find the maximum and the minimum element of the array using the minimum number of comparisons.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {3, 5, 4, 1, 9}
Output: Minimum element is: 1
              Maximum element is: 9

Input: arr[] = {22, 14, 8, 17, 35, 3}
Output:  Minimum element is: 3
              Maximum element is: 35

# Initialize largest and smallest with the first element
    largest = arr[0]
    smallest = arr[0]

    # Traverse the list starting from the second element
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > largest:
            largest = arr[i]
        if arr[i] < smallest:
            smallest = arr[i]

    # Print the maximum and minimum elements
    print("Largest element:", largest)
    print("Smallest element:", smallest)

arr = [3, 5, 1, 8, 2]
find_max_min(None, arr)
